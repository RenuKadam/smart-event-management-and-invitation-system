MERN Stack
Developed a full-stack Event Management System using the MERN Stack, supporting two roles: Organizer (Admin) and User. Organizers can manage events, scan QR codes for attendance via OTP validation, and access detailed reports and analytics. Users can manage their profiles, book events through an integrated payment gateway, and receive downloadable QR codes and unique invitation codes for event entry. The system ensures secure access and attendance tracking through QR and OTP integration.
